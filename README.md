## hello there, i'm john patrick adem

* i'm just an ordinary 19 year old in the philippines that happens to deal with some code (as a fun hobby)
* discovered the ReVanced project at july 2, 2023 (i was looking for a vanced alternative back then)
* i'm still not confident in my english, and still wack at japanese language (0.7% / 100%)
* i only know these languages: javascript, java, html, css, and c# (javascript at the basic level of knowledge, c# and java are the languages i still can't get right)
* i love playing the pc releases of the gta trilogy (not the definitive though), i also know a little bit of gta san andreas cleo scripting

i just love seeing tech break, goldmine for me to debug and inspect on

***

<sup>i'm just destined to have no lifelong friends (sucks, but it is what it is)</sup>
